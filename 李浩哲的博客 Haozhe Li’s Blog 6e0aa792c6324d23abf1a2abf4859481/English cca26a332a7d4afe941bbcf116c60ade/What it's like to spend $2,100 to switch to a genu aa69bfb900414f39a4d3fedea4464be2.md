# What it's like to spend $2,100 to switch to a genuine Da Vinci Resolve Studio for a month

First of all, it should be noted that Da Vinci contains two versions: the Resolve version and the Studio version. The former is free, but has restrictions on some professional features (such as color science) and presets; the latter is a paid version with a $2,100 buyout system. I had been using the Resolve version, but many presets are limited, and I believe that people who have switched from PR are not very adaptable.

So in this case, I spent a few bucks to buy the Studio learning version in a treasure, but the experience was extremely poor. First of all, the configuration of my computer, as a student party, my use of the Glory MagicBook 2019 R5-3500U 8 + 512, it can be said that the performance pull across. When using the learning version of Studio, not to mention the regular flashbacks, rendering and preview speed is also very terrible: 4K 25FPS video with effects can never be rendered no matter how to change the configuration, 1080P 25FPS video rendering is an average of 3 frames per second, plus special effects may be 0.5 frames per second.

But when I purchased the activation code, I downloaded the latest version 17.3 Studio on the official website directly after the good guys. First of all, the loading speed of the loading screen before entering Da Vinci is more than 10 times the original (the original about two minutes?). Sometimes also flashback. Now [load palette] [load Fairlight] or whatever is all a flash, the fastest 5 seconds to enter the project list. Preview, rendering speed is also scary: 4K with special effects and super zoom effect clips can be rendered at the speed of 3 frames per second, 1080P video rendering without special effects can be 60-70 frames per second, directly 20 times faster than the original. Fusion color grading, editing and other panel switching was also a click on the card 10 seconds, now almost seconds cut.

In a nutshell, it's not a bad deal for 2100! I can't wait to change my Macbook Pro to M1, but now I find that my computer is so good at it. 2100 is the original version, and in a way it saves me the money of a Macbook Pro.
