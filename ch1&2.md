# Chapter 1 & 2 - Location Parameters & Scale Parameters

## Mean

- **Definition:** The average of all data points.
- **Formula:** $$ \mu \text{ (population mean) or } \bar{x} \text{ (sample mean)} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n} $$
- **Properties:**
  - Sensitive to outliers.
  - Used for interval and ratio level of measurement.

## Median
- **Definition:** The middle value when data points are ordered.
- **Properties:**
  - Not affected by outliers.
  - Can be used for ordinal, interval, and ratio levels of measurement.

## Standard Deviation
- **Definition:** A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values.
- **Formula:** $$ \sigma \text{ (population standard deviation) or } s \text{ (sample standard deviation)} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_i - \text{mean})^2}{n - 1}} $$
- **Properties:**
  - Square root of variance.
  - Has the same units as the data points.

## Variance
- **Definition:** The average of the squared differences from the Mean.
- **Formula:** $$ \sigma^2 \text{ (population variance) or } s^2 \text{ (sample variance)} = \frac{\sum (x_i - \text{mean})^2}{n - 1} $$
- **Properties:**
  - Measures variability from the mean.
  - Affected by outliers.

## Interquartile Range (IQR)
- **Definition:** A measure of statistical dispersion, being equal to the difference between 75th and 25th percentiles, or between upper and lower quartiles.
- **Formula:** $$ \text{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1 $$
- **Properties:**
  - Represents the middle 50% of data.
  - Not affected by outliers.

## Standard Coordinates (z-scores)
- **Definition:** Normalized values showing how many standard deviations an element is from the mean.
- **Formula:** $$ z = \frac{x_i - \mu}{\sigma} $$
- **Properties:**
  - Used in standardizing data.
  - Makes data comparable.

## Correlation Coefficient
- **Definition:** A statistical measure that expresses the extent to which two variables are linearly related (direction and strength).
- **Formula:** $$ r = \frac{\sum [(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})]}{\sqrt{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2 \times \sum (y_i - \bar{y})^2}} $$
- **Properties:**
  - Values range between -1 and 1.
  - 0 indicates no linear correlation.
  - +1 indicates a perfect positive linear correlation.
  - -1 indicates a perfect negative linear correlation.

## Outliers
- **Definition:** An outlier is a data point that differs significantly from other observations.
- **Properties:**
  - Can significantly skew your data.
  - Important to identify and handle them appropriately.

## Correlation's Definition in Standard Coordinates
- **Definition:** Correlation in standard coordinates involves normalizing the values of both variables so that each variable has a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 before calculating the correlation coefficient.

## Linear Prediction
- **Definition:** The correlation coefficient can be used to predict the value of one variable based on the value of another, given that there is a linear relationship between the two.
- **Linear Predictor Formula (Regression Equation):**
  - Simple linear regression: $\hat{y}^p =\hat{x}\times r$  where r is the correlation coefficient.
- **Properties:**
  - The strength of the correlation coefficient indicates the reliability of the prediction.
  - The sign indicates the direction of the relationship (positive or negative).
